# Assignment Overview:
We would like you to design a simplified Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. For this assignment, your tool should be capable of defining and applying configurations for a few different resource types. Specifically, we're interested in seeing how you would manage:

- A virtual machine
- A network configuration
- A database instance

 Your solution should enable users to define the desired state of these resources in configuration files and apply these configurations to create
 or update the resources accordingly.

 # Objectives:

- Develop a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) for users to apply configurations.
- Implement functionality to parse configuration files for each of the specified resource types and apply the defined settings.
- Provide setup and usage instructions, along with a brief explanation of your design decisions and any assumptions made.

# Evaluation Criteria:
Your submission will be evaluated based on code quality, understanding of IaC principles, problem-solving skills, and adherence to the project instructions. We're also keen to understand your thought process, so please include documentation of your design decisions.

# Optional Focus:
While you are free to design your tool with any cloud provider in mind, you may choose to focus on compatibility with AWS, Azure, or GCP if you have specific experience with these platforms. This is optional, but it could help us see how your skills align with our current technology stack.

# Submission Guidelines:

Please complete this assignment by Friday end of day
Submit your code via email. Please tar up your code, configuration, and Git history and reply to this email.
