Models:
- Abstract Resource (name, )
  - VM (cpu, memory, os, network)
  - Network Configuration (traffic rules, connections, subnets)
  - DB (size, startup)
- Can use yaml to specify these
  - Would probably want some sort of schema for validation. Will not focus on this at the moment.

Provider Service:
- IProvider with methods to create, get, update resources
  - AWS
  - GCP (probably just implement this one)
  - Azure

CLI:
- written in c#
- need some sort of orchestrator to manage reading the commands
- need some sort of handler for each major sub command (get, create, etc)
- commands that would be required:
  - Install/run/apply template
- commands that would be useful
  - Initialize new project
  - Validate
  - Get current state
  - Dry run
